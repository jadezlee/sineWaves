# sineWaves
Generative art created with sine waves. Inspiration derived from code created by Daniel Schiffman on Processing. The link is here: https://processing.org/examples/sinewave.html. The original code modified to add a wave class to be able to add as many waves as wanted with different amplitudes, periods, theta, etxc.
